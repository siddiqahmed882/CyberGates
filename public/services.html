                A method that evaluates the security of a network system by conducting an analysis and subsequent
                examination of potential gaps or "holes" within security operations, flaws within hardware or software
                configuration or other operational weaknesses that may exist. Once completed these tests expose security
                vulnerabilities, assess the impact should a potential security threat occur and follow with a proposal
                of a technical solution. The outcome of these tests allows businesses to make sound security decisions
                under certain circumstances such as setting up a new office, deployment of a new network infrastructure
                or upgrading existing or new applications.

                Vulnerability Assessment (VA) is the process of measuring and prioritizing risks associated with network
                and host-based systems to allow rational planning of technologies and activities that manage business
                risk. Vulnerability Assessment (VA) tools allow customization of security policy, automated analysis of
                vulnerabilities, and creation of reports that effectively communicate security vulnerability discoveries
                and detailed corrective actions to all levels of an organization. Vulnerability Assessment involves
                design, development and review of security policies, procedures, and standards, and validation of the
                state of security of the information technology infrastructure.

                Unlike a network penetration test, a web application penetration test focuses on the security and
                potential risks present with a web application. Using methods attackers use to infiltrate web
                applications to obtain financial, personal and even medical information, these tests allow programmers
                to assess weaknesses in both server and client-side applications.

                The scope of this audit is to manually review the source code of software or firmware to identify

                integrated open source components or standard libraries used by the software in question. CYBER GATES
