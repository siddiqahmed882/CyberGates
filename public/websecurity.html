            <h4 class="card__title">Protect valuable data and information</h4>
            <p>Protecting sensitive data is the end goal of almost all IT security measures. Two strong arguments for
              protecting sensitive data are to avoid identity theft and to protect privacy.</p>
            <p>The more valuable the information in your database, the more likely it is to be targeted. If your records
              include sensitive or financial information that could facilitate fraud, your database will be more
              appealing to hackers who can use or sell this information for financial gain.</p>

            <h4 class="card__title">Keep your money safe from hackers</h4>
            <p>Insecure server configuration and other known security vulnerabilities could potentially lead to
              financial loss arising from theft of corporate and financial information, theft of money, disruption to
              trading, loss of business or contract.</p>
            <p>As a way of protecting consumers against this kind of risk, ecommerce and other websites that collect
              customer credit and payments must be
              <a href="#">PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliant.</a>

            <h4 class="card__title">Protect your brand reputation</h4>
            <p>Your brand is the foundation of your business. It doesn't matter if you are a small business, corporation
              or something in between, a successful cyber attack can cause major damage to your business reputation and
              consumer trust. As a result, this could potentially lead to loss of customers, loss of sales and reduction
              in profits.</p>
            <p>Reputational damage can even impact on your suppliers, or affect relationships you may have with
              partners, investors and other third parties vested in your business.</p>

            <h4 class="card__title">Evaluate risk in your business</h4>
            <p>If your website has vulnerabilities, it is increasingly likely they will be identified and exploited by
              hackers. Thinking about the worst things that could happen to your business can help you deal with smaller
              risks.</p>
            <p>Risk evaluation allows you to determine the importance of potential risks to your online business. You
              can then decide to accept the specific risk or take action to prevent or minimize it.</p>
